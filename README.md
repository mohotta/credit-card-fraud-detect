# credit-card-fraud-detect
Credit card fraud detection neural network developed by tensorflow.<br>
Dataset used for training: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/credit-card-fraud-detection-dataset-2023 <br>
train accuracy: 0.9997 (same dataset) <br>
test accuracy: 0.9996 (same dataset) <br>

No real-life use with this though, kaggle has anonymized the features so, we cannot predict fraud using real-life data.
